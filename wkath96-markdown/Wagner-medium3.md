# **WHAT HAPPENS TO KIDS WITH A POOR EDUCATION?**
**"Life isn't fair."**

You've probably come across that old aphorism more than once throughout your lifetime--maybe when you were screaming at your mother for giving your brother a bigger piece of cake as a child, or maybe when you weren't accepted to the college of your dreams. Eventually, as we wander through life, we learn that success is never "guaranteed" to us, simply because we exist.

But that's an easy enough truth for me to swallow--I'm a middle class white girl who grew up in an American suburb. In the lottery of life, I pretty much won a golden ticket.

But what about those children who _weren't_ born with a silver spoon in their mouths? All those kids who never had the privilege to complain about taking AP tests in high school? All those kids who never knew where their next meal was coming from? All those kids who never even [learned how to read](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/06/illiteracy-rate_n_3880355.html)?

There is an uncomfortable truth we have to face: no--life isn't fair, but to those born into a disadvantaged situation, "fairness" is measured on a grossly different scale. Some children are simply not given the same opportunities as others, particularly regarding education. And the results from this innate inequality are devastating; **those who suffer from poor educations throughout their childhoods face a lifetime of consequences.**

## Let's Talk About Poverty
Before we can even think about discussing educational inequalities, we have to address the elephant in the room: poverty. Poverty and education are tied together. No one born into a wealthy household will have to worry about growing up with a poor education, and no one born into poor household will be automatically gifted with a great education. The child born into poverty will have to fight an uphill battle for just a fraction of the opportunities the wealthy child was gifted. And sometimes, those opportunities will just _never_ be available to the poor child.

There is a cyclical relationship between poverty and education; often those who are struggling to survive will quit school at an early age so that they can work to support their families. But this is a catch-22; quitting school prevents them from gaining vital skills in literary and numeracy, which, in turn, prevents them from ever achieving careers that pay better, which could propel them _out_ of poverty. Poverty--and, by association, poor education--thus becomes generational.

And keep in mind I'm approaching this topic from an American perspective, under the assumption that access to some form of education is a guarantee. In some countries, especially developing countries, public education might be either [unavailable or inaccessible ](https://www.childfund.org/about-us/education/)(classrooms might have broken desks and outdated technology; textbooks might be unaffordable and students might have to spend over an hour on a bus each way to school).

**There is no simple solution to poverty.** No one would claim otherwise. But it is important to understand that educational inequality is more than a matter of some students having lower test scores. Children with poor educations are often a part of a greater, more complex cycle than we would like to acknowledge.

## So What's the Worst that Can Happen?
Sure, we understand that poverty is linked with a lack of education (and vice versa). But that's it, right? It's not like having a poor education can ruin you for life.

Unfortunately, much of the data says otherwise.

**It starts with the brain.** Several recent [neuroscientific studies](http://www.scilearn.com/blog/ten-facts-about-how-poverty-impacts-education) have documented the links between poverty and poor education. The brain is more "plastic," or malleable, when we are young. The value of nurturing our children's' brains during these earliest stages of life therefore _cannot_ be overstated.

A simple example is that children from poor households have less verbal exposure. [A famous 1995 study](http://literacy.rice.edu/thirty-million-word-gapshows) that children from poor households hear 32 million __fewer__ words than those from wealthy homes; this is known as the "thirty million word gap." A dearth of language inhibits the potential of a young brain, eager for expansion.

**It sets the stage for their future.**
In a world increasingly ruled by technology, education is only becoming more vital for success. An estimated [85% of current jobs and 90% of new jobs](https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-education-america) require a college or post-secondary education.

So here is what's truly alarming: low-income students are [four and a half times more likely to drop out of high school](http://www.scilearn.com/blog/ten-facts-about-how-poverty-impacts-education) than their wealthy peers. For the disadvantaged who _do_ manage to graduate, they have to contend the a score gap in the SAT--one of the premier standardized tests for assessing college eligibility-- of more than [42%.](http://www.scilearn.com/blog/ten-facts-about-how-poverty-impacts-education)

## So What Can We Do?
I know--reading about so much inequality in the world is depressing, but **don't let it be disheartening.** No, life may not ever be completely fair. But there are [ways we can work](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2528798/) to minimize the inequalities that continue to plague our world:

* Support programs that strive for educational equality.
* Advocate for intervention programs that help disadvantaged youths.
* Raise awareness by discussing the issue with your peers.
* **Get involved directly.** There are opportunities to support education all around you. Volunteer to read to young children in your area. Raise money in a fundraiser. Or even sign up to become a teacher, and help take matters into your own hands.

Again, no one is claiming that this fight will be easy, but it is _so_ worth the effort. Social inequalities leave millions of children without any voice, and we doom them to a cycle that steals their success. **No life is worth more than another.** We cannot forget that. We have to care about each other.
