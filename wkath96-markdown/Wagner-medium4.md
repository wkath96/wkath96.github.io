# Let's Talk About Teach for America
If you've ever been interested in the debate about the future of education in America, then you've possibly come across the name "Teach for America" at least once during your research.

My interest in Teach for America only began this past year, when one of my roommates began applying for the organization. I mentioned her application to a few friends, only to hear various horror stories about experiences people have had throughout the process. Some claimed that the organization was racist. One noted that a student pulled a gun on her friend in the program. __There are__ clear controversies about the program.

But, upon exploring the organization further, it is clear that Teach for America is very aware of the criticisms people have thrown at it. It tackles many of these condemnations on its very own  [website.](https://www.teachforamerica.org/) Still, that is not to say Teach for America is a perfect organization. We owe it to those who have applied or who have considered applying--my roommate included--to fairly discuss the organization. So let's talk about it.

## So What Is Teach for America?
Teach for America began as a dream of [a Princeton senior](http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/12/education/wendy-kopp-leader-of-teach-for-america.html?pagewanted=all), Wendy Kopp, who had never stepped foot into a classroom, but had the dream of placing fresh-faced teachers into impoverished classrooms across America.

The Teach for America website opens onto an appealing blue banner, where a white bolded title states "Where Justice Begins," followed by the sage claim:

_A just society begins with a great education for all. Today 9% of kids in low-income communities will graduate from college. You can change this._

So that's the premise. Teach for America markets itself towards recent college graduates--idealists who truly want to make a difference in the world and to help out children born into disadvantaged situations. Those who join the organization are obligated to spend two years teaching, generally in a low-income location of their choice (they operate everywhere from Appalachia to Seattle).

## Addressing the Controversies
You might already see some problems with this setup. The students joining their teaching force likely aren't the most qualified applicants. Nor are they necessarily dedicated to a career in education, as __it is__ only required for two years.

However, you might look again and think that people are getting worked up over nothing here. What's so wrong, exactly, with dedicated, eager young teachers dedicating their lives towards helping out students in underserved areas?

Yet, for some older teachers with [years of experience in public education](http://progressive.org/public-school-shakedown/went-wrong-teach-america/), the idea of sending young teachers into the workforce with only a few weeks of experience sits uneasily with them.

There is a lot of cynicism of about the impact these college graduates could actually have in the classroom. This is referred to as the "revolving door" of teachers, who cycle into and out of the students' lives, causing more harm __the__ help in the process. Many view these applicants not merely as fresh-faced idealists, but as a gaggle of rich white kids wanting to play teacher for two years before they apply to Harvard or Google.

Teach for America [addresses many of these concerns](https://www.teachforamerica.org/our-impact) head-on, however, through a statistical breakdown of their corps: 34% of members were the first in their family to attend college; 65% of their alumni work full-time in education, and 82% work full-time in roles impacting education of low-income communities; and [various studies](https://www.teachforamerica.org/about-us/research) have indicated that their teachers are just as, if not _more_ successful then more "qualified" teachers. Considering [overall teacher burnout](https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-education-america) is one of the greatest issues facing teaching throughout America as a whole (14% of new teachers resign by the end of their first year, 33% leave within their first 3 years, and almost 50% leave by their 5th year), Teach for America's numbers are respectable.

## Is It Worth It?
You might be in a position where you are actually considering joining Teach for America yourself. I, in fact, would consider myself one of those individuals. So the question now is simple: is Teach for America actually worth joining?

I believe it is.

A simple Google search of the organization will result in countless criticisms of its work. Some people say Teach for America is [unwilling to change](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/10/20/teach-for-americas-biggest-problem-isnt-green-teachers-or-failing-schools-its-that-it-cant-take-criticism/?utm_term=.44c0b2ada692). More dramatically, some claim that Teach for America is ["working to destroy the public education system"](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sandra-korn/why-i-said-no-to-teach-for-america_b_4151764.html).

But it is too easy to drown in the sea of critics. The people who are important to listen to are [those who have actually undergone the experience](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Teach-For-America/reviews). For most corps members, Teach for America is a life-changing, inspiring experience, that motivates them to work even harder towards the dream of educational inequality.

And so, if you are a dreamer, an idealist, or a reformer, don't be scared to take advantage of this opportunity for yourself. Decide if it is right for you, but don't let the critics discourage you; listen to the voices that have been on the frontlines.
